# CPS 218 Chapter 1 Assignment
These are the "Review Questions" for Chapter 1.

## Question 1
> Which of the following components comprise an operating system? (Choose all that apply.)
> a.  user interface
> b.  kernel
> c.  device drivers
> d.  services

### Answer
* a, b, c, d
    * You should be be aware that these are part of the OS from experience tinkering with Linux components before.

## Question 2
> Which of the following kernels are development kernels? (Choose all that apply.)
> a. 2.3.4
> b. 4.5.5
> c. 5.10-rc5
> d. 6.0.0

### Answer
* a, c
    * Choice (a) is using the old Linux kernel versioning of "odd minor numbers for release candidates" (for versions equal to or older than `2.5*`).
    * Choice (c) is a release candidate, indicated by the newer practice of using the `*rc` suffix.

## Question 3
> Many types of software are available today. Which type of software does Linux represent?
> a. open source
> b. closed source
> c. freeware
> d. shareware

### Answer
* a
    * Many Linux applications are primarily licensed under either GPLv2+ or MIT.
    * (You have to visually inspect for software licensing when submitting third-party Linux packages.)

## Question 4
> Which of the following are characteristics of OSS?  (Choose all that apply.)
> a. The value of the software is directly related to its price.
> b. The software is developed collaboratively.
> c. The source code for software is available for a small fee.
> d. Bugs are fixed quickly.

### Answer
* b, d
    * Regarding basic theoretical principles of Linux, these are true.
    * However, there are some well-regarded projects that are not community-based projects and/or bugs cannot be easily found, despite practices such as using GPLv3 licensing.
        * For example regarding the former, Pop!\_OS is a project run by System76.  While welcoming patches from the community for bug fixes with small scope, System76 ultimately has the ultimate power to dictate what to do regarding steering the project long-term.
        * For example regarding the latter, the Linux kernel has a massive code base, so the average Linux user isn't going to be able to audit the Linux kernel.

## Question 5
> To which license does Linux adhere?
> a. BSD
> b. MIT
> c. GNU GPL
> d. Apache

### Answer
* c
    * IIRC the Linux kernel is primarily based on the GPLv2 license.

## Question 6
> What are some good reasons for using Linux in a corporate environment? (Choose all that apply.)
> a. Linux software is unlikely to be abandoned by its developers.
> b. Linux is secure and has a lower total cost of ownership than other operating systems.
> c. Linux is widely available for many hardware platforms and supports many programming languages.
> d. Most Linux software is closed source.

### Answer
* a, b, c
    * This comes from reading the text.

## Question 7
> Which of the following are common methods for gaining support for Linux?
> a. websites
> b. Linux User Groups
> c. online forums
> d. all these methods

### Answer
* d
    * I don't know how I would feel getting support from the Arch Linux forum (but that's neither here nor there).
